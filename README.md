## Wordle Solver 

Linux shell version of a wordle solver.  Hopefully it's documented 
enough to use.  Going through this exercise with a class so I wanted
to be able to share it afterwards with them.

Make sure you chmod your permissions if it didn't download as a script.
Then edit wordle.sh to fill in your guesses and ./wordle.sh to run it.
./reset.sh will just overwrite the file to reset it for another round.
